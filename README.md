## Full-Stack Software Engineer | Health-Tech Specialist
**Bridging the gap between complex clinical workflows and production-grade technical solutions.**

I build digital experiences informed by a career dedicated to high-stakes advocacy and strategic growth. With a background spanning **Critical Care Nursing**, **Military Leadership**, and **Enterprise Operations**, I bring a rare perspective to software engineering: I understand the patient, the customer, and the bottom line.

### Why I’m a unique asset to your engineering team:

* **Nursing-Grade Precision:** In the ICU, there is no room for "bugs." I bring that same meticulous attention to detail and calm-under-pressure problem solving to every pull request.
* **Domain Expertise (HealthTech):** Years of hands-on experience with EHRs (Epic/Cerner). I don't just build healthcare apps; I understand the high-stakes environment they live in.
* **Management-Ready Collaboration:** Having managed cross-functional teams and P&Ls, I speak the language of "Business Requirements" and translate them into "Scalable Code."
